Molly on medicine
=================

.. todo:: set a date

Molly sat on the floor, crisscross applesauce. Herman sat opposite her.
It was a position she clearly felt comfortable in, and he definitely
felt uncomfortable in, but he thought of it as all part of the process,
the life experience, of this pregnancy.

"Have you read any parenting books yet?" Molly asked.

"We got 'What to Expect When You're Expecting', said Herman, "and we
got 'How to Talk So Kids Will Listen and Listen So Kids Will Talk'."

"OK. That second book. Amazing. That's a keeper, because it's not just
about kids. The first book though, has some pros and cons." Molly gave
Herman her theatrical side-eye.

"What do you mean 'pros and cons'?" queried Herman.

"Well, let's start with the pros." Molly began with, "Please read
through all the stuff about pregnancy complications. Really take it in.
That stuff is real. The book has been accused of promoting paranoia,
but on a national scale pregnancy complications are a numbers game, and
as a Supreme Court Justice you ought to be aware of just how dangerous
pregnancy is. I owe it to everyone who can fall pregnant, and also to
you, that pregnancy is much, much more dangerous that changing your
mind part of the way through. And that doesn't take into consideration
the morbidity of pregnancy. Women who don't have kids live longer than
those who do.

"All those family planning clinics who are legally obligated to point
out to women, who come in wanting expert advice about their options,
that abortion is super dangerous, and all the terrible things that
could possibly happen to them if they go through with one, are lying to
them. Because having an abortion in a clinic, or by taking a pill, is
safer, much safer, always safer, than not having an abortion."

"Please don't lecture me, Molly," Herman requested politely.

Molly apologized. "I'm sorry. I appreciate that you didn't make those,
those ignorant, prejudicial laws. That wasn't my point. I'm sorry for
getting ranty. I just get worked up because ignorant people are hurting
innocent people, and I have a duty to them to push back."

"OK," Herman accepted.

"And to you now! I repect what you're doing here, Herman, I respect you
for acting on your sense of duty to your conscience. You are doing a
hard thing!"

Herman nodded, "Thank you."

"Tell me more about that?" promted Molly.

"Wait, first tell me about the cons." Herman wanted to know.

"Right! Yes, OK so the good thing is that Heidi Murkoff makes an effort
to be honest about the things that can go wrong. But she is accidentally
dishonest---and by that I mean she has the best intentions I'm sure,
she just happens to be mistaken, about her medical advice. Nothing she
says is harmful, I want to be clear about that. But as a person with a
medical doctorate, and a lot of experience in this field, that book has
a lot of misinformation in it about 'alternative medicine'." Molly made
scarequotes with her fingers.

"Hold up." Herman stopped her. "You've studied your area of expertise a
lot. I have studied my area of expertise a lot. I am recognized as an
expert, and you are recognized as an expert. So, from one expert to
another, and I mean this respectfully, isn't it a little presumptuous
... I hesitate to say it, but even arrogant, to say that your medicine
is the only medicine. Why can't you recognize Chinese medicine, Indian
medicine, or whatever? What makes Western medicine the only real
medicine?"

Molly looked at him, holding the pause, and let the smile spread across
her face slowly.

Herman suddenly wondered whether this was a moment she had practiced
for.

Molly said, "That is a great question, and I am so glad you asked. I
used to cover this with my freshers, because this feeling of yours is
pervasive across our society. Personally, I blame our high school, ah,
maybe even primary school, education. The crucial concept is so simple,
and so old, but we don't teach it to kids, and I think there is a good
reason for that, or a bad reason---depending on your perspective.

"First off, 'Western' medicine," Molly said with those scarequotes
again, "was all about the four humors, and bloodletting, and how night
air causes cholera and clamydia. I don't practice Western medicine. What
I practice is just medicine. Just like 'Islamic mathematics' is just
mathematics, or what Nazis referred to as 'Jewish physics' is just
physics, so some Chinese medicine is medicine, and some is not
medicine."

She paused, waiting for Herman to ask, and he smiled as he willingly
took the bait.

"So," he said with a smirk, "what's the difference."

"Well thank you for asking!" grinned Molly. "It's---oh, wait, no. Hold
that thought: 'What's the difference between medicine and alternative
medicine?' because first I want to connect it to something else.

"Do you know about Galileo?" Molly asked.

"What? The astronomer?" Herman was confused. What does astronomy have to
do with Chinese medicine?

"Yes! The thing that was so dangerous about Galileo---the thing that
ultimately got him executed---was not that he proposed that the Earth
orbited the sun. It was his principle that the most important thing was
evidence, and his disrespect for any authority that evidence did not
support. Galileo's patron was a guy called Barberini, who became Pope
Urban VIII. Rich, powerful guy. And a big fan of Galileo. But also a
big fan of Aristotle, who said the Earth was in the center of the
universe. Well, Galileo wrote a long thesis, in which he created a
character named 'Simplicio', which means idiot, who promotes the exact
opinion of Barberini, now Pope. And the thesis spends 400 pages
demonstrating how Simplicio, and Aristotle, and Barberini, are wrong.
No respect. Evidence is everything. Authority without evidence is
nothing. The Pope had many opportunities to pardon Galileo, to save his
life. He did not. Clearly he felt the disrespect. But there is more.
Every Pope knows that for his survival, for the survival of his
institution, authority must be everything, regardless of evidence.

"That's the difference between medicine, and not medicine." Molly
brought it back. "Medicine has evidence, at least, it tries to---we can
talk about that later---and everything else has unverifiable evidence,
or anecdotes like 'it works for me', or authority without evidence, or
ancient wisdom, which could be evidence but not always. The moment it
has evidence, it flips from not medicine to medicine."

"That all sounds reasonable," said Herman. "But all of the, well frankly
bullshit, that happened around Covid destroyed all a lot of my trust in
the whole medical industry. Should we wear masks, or doesn't it matter?
Was it leaked from a lab, or must we pretend that it wasn't? How much
testing should a vaccine get? How do we know if it's safe?"

Molly smiled again. Herman could see that she used her pauses to
deescalate the energy in the room.

She reached over to him, and placed her hands on his knees, palms up,
for him to take. He looked at them, thought about it for a second, and
then placed his hands in hers.

"Covid was a lesson for all of us about the process of medical science.
Science generally, but medicine especially," she said. "The thing is,
scientists are just people. When we encounter something new, like a
novel coronavirus, we start off with a big bunch of guesses, based on
our previous experience. We throw everything we can at the wall, and
see what sticks. Remember when we were all wiping down our shopping in
April 2020? That's because we thought it might survive on surfaces.
Turned out that wasn't a big problem. Turned out that airborn in closed
environments was a much bigger problem. Masks. Yeah, everyone should
have been wearing a mask. Not so that you don't catch it, although that
as well, but mostly so that you don't spread it before you even know
you have it. And I don't want to talk about vaccines, not because of the
science, but because of the politics. We can save that one for later
maybe.

"Covid taught us a lot. Not just that evidence is the *sine qua non*,
but also that authority is important, as long as it is authority backed
by evidence. Don't take medical advice from a lawyer. Don't take
medical advice from a priest. Don't take medical advice from a
biologist, even if they have a doctorate. Definitely don't take medical
advice from a podcast host.

Sometimes not all of the experts agree, especially when something new
comes up and people are dying and everyone is scrambling. You can't do
any better than go with the majority, and be prepared to let go of your
favorite ideas if the majority shifts. Because that's exactly what
should happen as we keep collecting more evidence."

"So you're saying I can't trust anyone," said Herman.

"I'm saying it's not about trusting people. It's about building out a
reliable foundation of evidence. In the beginning we won't have a lot,
but we keep at it, and as we get a clearer and clearer picture, the
speculations, and wide variations of opinions will gradually coalesce,"
Molly clarified.

"OK, but how do I verify those opinions. Am I supposed to do my own
research?" asked Herman.

"Ha! No. That's what those QAnon folks say, don't they? 'Do your own
research.' Research is hard. Research is expensive. It takes a very long
time. Oh, man, I really wish they covered this in high school, because
it's actually really interesting, what real research really looks like.
It's not a thing you can do on your own, in a matter of hours or even
days, diving head-first down a YouTube rabbit hole."

"Right. So what do I do?" Herman asked again.

"You adopt a trust network. Well you already do. We all have trust
networks. It's just a fancy name for the people we trust, and how we
weight their opinions in our minds. What we need to do is evaluate
their opinions based our best guess at the quality of their evidence.
Is it 'I saw on YouTube ...', or is it, 'a recent paper in Nature
magazine,' or rather, 'a meta-analysis of a bunch of papers...'. Maybe
a science podcast, with a comparison of research. You can find them.
That sounds boring, but some of them are super interesting."

Herman had a blank expression.

"OK," said Molly, "maybe it's just me who thinks they're interesting,
I'm prepared to acknowledge that."

"OK," said Herman. "I've got all that. One more thing. Back to medicine
and alternative medicine. It seems to me that medicine is claiming that
alternative medicine is wrong, even when it doesn't have the evidence
to prove that it's wrong. Like the whole Ivermectin thing for example.
A lot of people were promoting Ivermectin as a treatment, and other
people were rubbishing it, even before they'd done proper tests."

"Oh I love this point," said Molly. "Thank you, again, for asking such
great questions. You are absolutely right. And to be fair to the
scientists who were skeptical, Ivermectin is a medication for a
parasite, so it was always unlikely to be an effective treatment for a
virus, but you are right, they didn't know. And that is probably one of
the most important principles about science. Knowledge is justified
true belief. Even if it's true, if it's not justified then it's not
knowledge; it's a lucky guess. Maybe even an educated guess. But not
knowledge. One of the most important aspects of science, and especially
medicine, is being honest to yourself, and to your patients, and to the
public, about what you don't know. So much about medicine is about
consent, and consent requires the patient to be informed, and if you
don't know, you have to tell them. Give them the statistics. Frame it
in a way that allows them to make the wisest choice, even with
incomplete information.

"We can't always know everything. That's OK. It's just how it is. But
acknowledging our level of confidence is not just good science, it is a
moral imperative. It applies to medicine, and science, and everything in
life.

"Oh, and one more thing. This is a dangerous point, and ties back to
Galileo: Narratives, including religious narratives, are important, and
valuable for society. The stories we apply to ourselves determine our
morality, our wellbeing, our success and sense of fulfillment.
Narratives are so important. But they don't lose any of their power if
we are honest to ourselves about whether or not they are factual. Think
about how inspirational the Harry Potter stories have been for a
generation, or before that the Lord of the Rings. Universal themes of
courage, and duty, and love as an act not just a feeling. But we all
understand that these narratives aren't historical facts. That doesn't
make them any less important or powerful. The same is true for
religion."

"Are you saying that my religion is not historically factual. It sounds
like that's what you're saying." Herman corrected Molly, "You need to
know that there is overwhelming evidence supporting my religious
beliefs."

"I overstepped a boundary there, and I'm sorry for that." Molly
apologized. "I did not mean that Christianity is fictitious the way
Harry Potter or the Lord of the Rings are. Not at all. But I am saying
that the evidence for some of the claims is less than, say, what I
would want before I confidently prescribe a particular medication. And
I'm also saying that that is OK. Like, let's think about the Ascension.
Would Jesus have passed out at 30,000 feet? Well, that's not a good
question, because before we can ask that question we first need to know
whether the Ascension is historical fact, or a metaphor, or a narrative
device. It's like asking whether the giant eagles could have picked up
Golum, with the Ring of Power, right in Book One, and just dropped him
into Mount Doom. That's not a good question, because what is the
purpose of the story? The question assumes that the purpose of the
story is to destroy the ring. No. The purpose of the story is to learn
about the role of ordinary people like us in the cosmic struggle that
we are all a part of.

"Asking which parts of your religious beliefs are historically factual,
and exactly which parts are not, is asking the wrong question. What we
learn from medicine, and I mean medicine medicine, is that it is OK to
acknowledge what we don't know. Honesty with ourselves and with each
other is a moral duty. What if we apply that moral duty to Christianity?
We can see that the gospels present four variations of a narrative. What
is the purpose of that narrative? And given that purpose, does it matter
that the Hebrew word for 'young woman' in a prophesy in the book of
Isaiah is mistranslated into Greek as 'virgin' in the Septuagint, the
ancient Greek translation of the Hebrew Bible, and because of that
mistranslation, Mary is a virgin in the gospels of Matthew and Luke? No!
That doesn't mean that Christianity is wrong. It means that we need to
be honest with ourselves and each other. We need to look at the
narrative differently, and ask ourselves different questions. What does
that mistranslation teach us about the narrative, and it's purpose?"

"Yeah. You have overstepped a boundary." Herman took his hands out of
hers. But Molly held his gaze.

"You are an honest and dutiful man, Herman. The lessons we learn from
medicine and science can be applied to other things too. They teach us
how to determine what is right. I talked about religion because I think
it's important to you, but these lessons also apply to law, and how to
think about whether to continue a life-threatening pregnancy or not.

"This pregnancy is transforming you. Afterwards you will be a different
person. And I have no doubt a stronger, wiser, better person. It is a
huge honor to be a part of this process with you. I will do everything I
can to help you get the most out of this process. One aspect of the help
I am giving you is sharing with you how we know things, how we don't
know things, and how to live with that difference. There is going to be
a lot about your baby that you don't know. Maya Angelou once said, 'I
did then what I knew how to do. Now that I know better, I do better.'
Notice that implicit in that statement is an acknowledgement of her
ignorance in the past, and also in the present. This is what medicine
is, and science, and being a parent, and being a lawyer and a judge, and
how the gospels understand the Old Testament, and how we apply the
narrative of the gospels to ourselves."

"OK." Herman said, "OK. You better go home. Leave me to think."

He lay in bed that night, listening to Gwin breathing next to him. He
could not stop thinking about what exactly was the meaning of the
narrative of the gospels? Molly made it sound like she just assumed he
knew. Well what is the evidence that the universe was created
specifically by the God of Abraham, and not, say, some Buddhist concept
of consciousness, or no god at all? Would the meaning of the gospels
really be just as valid regardless? What exactly do the gospels mean if
they aren't literally true?

The reason he had decided to carry through with this pregnancy, was
because life is sacred. If he has a duty to be honest to himself that
he doesn't really have a foundation of evidence to prove that the
universe was created by the God of Abraham, then is life still sacred?
Is he suffering though this pregnancy, and risking his life, for
nothing? Where does life get its value from, if not from God?

Do we give life its value?

If we do, Herman decided, then he still ought to be pregnant, because
his baby was valuable to him.
