The Family Defense Foundation
=============================

.. note:: November 2014

The elections had been exhausting, both personally, and for his whole
family, and so Bill Palatine decided to take his wife, Mary, and their
two boys, Cory and Jake, to the French Alps in December for a skiing
vacation. He pitched it to his personal assistant, Maritta, over
WhatsApp:

**Maritta**

    "M"

"Hey"

    "I'm thinking of taking Mary and the boys to France, to ski. Wanna
    come?"

"ü§© Sure! When?"

    "December, over Christmas"

"ü§î John?"

    "Oh, of course John can come too! All expenses, French Alps, skiing
    Christmas vacation! What do you say?"

"Sounds amazinggg. John might need convincing but I can be very
persuasive. üòèüòâüòá"

    "I know! üòÄ Keep me posted. I'll book for the two of you."

**Maritta**

    "M"

"Hey"

    "John there?"

"No, he's left early this morning. He's spending the day on the black
slope."

    "Mary and the boys just left. They want to spend the morning on the
    slopes, then Mary wants to take them into the town to do some
    shopping ..."

    "Wanna come over to my suite?"

    "Maybe we can explore some slopes by ourselves ... mountains ...
    valleys"

"LOLOLOL you are so cheesy billy üòª cu in 5"

"You stupid piece of shit Bill! Her fucking panties. Her tiny fucking
panties. I found them under the bed. Not just a piece of shit. A stupid
fucking piece of shit."

"Mary. Mary. Calm down. It's fine."

"Fuck off."

"It's fine. It's totally not a big deal. It was just a little thing.
Come on. You would too. Don't tell me you didn't look at John and it
didn't cross your mind."

"You are what you do Bill. I'm not fucking my husband's P.A.'s huband.
Because I'm not the stupid fucking piece of shit. You are, Bill. Jesus.
You're such a clich√©."

"Yeah, you know why? You know why men fuck their P.A.s? Because being a
man is like being chained to a five hundred pound gorilla. Sometimes
your body just drags you. But you wouldn't know what that's like. Men
and women are different, and you will never understand how difficult it
is to be me."

"Oh boo fucking hoo. 'My dick made me do it'? That's your story? You're
not just a clich√©. You're a pathetic clich√©. I can't actually look at
you right now. I'm going home."

"Baby. Don't do that. It was just the one time. It meant nothing. It's
all over. If you go home, what are we going to tell the boys? What
about Maritta and John?"

"Dude. You're the fucking congressman. Bullshit excuses are what you do
for a living. You'll come up with something."

**Mary**

"William"

    "How you doing Mary?"

"Guess what?"

    "I'm too worried to guess. You going to forgive me?"

"This shit just gets better and better. I'm pregnant."

    "Oh shit"

"Oh shit is right William. How do we fix this? You don't want this. I
don't want this. And I know for sure you don't want the press to get a
sniff of this, after all that pro-life party-line shit you fed the
base."

    "I can speak to some people. Mary. I love you. Everything is going
    to be fine."

"Whatever. Just fix this. Then maybe MAYBE we can talk about how
everything is going to be fine. Nothing is fine right now."

**Maritta**

"Billy?"

    "Hey"

"Can I call? ü•∫ü•∫ü•∫ü•∫ü•∫ü•∫ü•∫"

    "30s"

Bill went through to the bedroom and closed the door. And locked it.
Then he went thorugh to the en-suite bathroom, closed the door, and
locked it. Then he called his former P.A.

Maritta answered, "Billy?"

"Hey Maritta. You OK?"

"No Billy." Her voice was soaked in tears.

"What's wrong sweety?" Bill sat down on the lid of the toilet.

"I'm." She was struggling with words. "Well." His question raised a
question of her own. "Am I? Your sweety?"

"Of course you are Ritta!" Bill stated. "I care about you! Deeply!"

"Well, OK. Uh, that's good, then. Because. I'm pregnant."

"Ah." Bill sank. "Right."

"Billy?"

"Yeah. I'm here. You ... you don't want it, do you?"

"No! I'm married. John and I always use condoms. He won't believe me if
I say it's his. I mean he still doesn't know about us. But he might ask
for a paternity test, and then what? I know you're pro-life and
everything, Billy, but please, this is different. This will ruin your
life and mine. You have to help me."

"Of course. Of course, Ritta. I'll see what I can do. Give me a couple
days. I'll call you back."

Louise Newton answered her desk phone, "Louise Newton."

Maritta asked, "Hi, is that Ms Newton?"

Louise confirmed, "Speaking."

"Hi Ms Newton. My name is Maritta Lewis. I have a sensitive issue that
I might need some legal help with. And I should state up front that I
am a P.A. and I don't have a lot of money. Do you help people like me?"

"All my clients are people like you, Ms Lewis," Louise assured. "Can
you tell me a little more about your situation over the phone, or would
you like to arrange a meeting?"

"Is this call covered by attorney client privilege?"

"If you choose to hire me as your attorney, yes, it would be."

"Well, my situation involves someone you'd know. A lot of people know.
Um, you know what, maybe a meeting would be best."

Louise's leg dangled over her husband's leg, and his hand rested on her
thigh, as they watched TV. Louise took the remote and pressed "pause".
"Baby, I've been thinking."

"You know how I feel about you thinking my Love," joked Rob Searle.

She poked his pectoral muscle. "I have a pregnant client, and the father
is a pro-life congressman, and he says he'd gladly fly her out of
state, but he can't pay for anything, cos his wife is thinking of
divorcing him, and if anyone goes through his finances and this shows
up he's screwed."

"Republican?"

"What do you think?" smirked Louise.

"It's always the fucking Republican fake pro-lifers who are totally
onboard with abortions when it's their mistresses. And it's also the
fucking Republicans who can't have their hypocracy found out, cos their
voters don't think they're voting for politicians, they think they're
voting for saints."

"Yes, Baby. I know." Rob's litle rants were endearing and all, but she
had an idea, an actual, practical idea, she needed to discuss. "Listen.
This is not the only case like this. It's the same shit every time. But
this time I'm going to do something about it. I want to start a project.
Maybe team up with the Nelsons. I've had enough of rearranging the deck
chairs. You saw the Republican gains in November. All that 'Hope' and
'Change' shit. We both know what's happening to the A.C.A. When you
can't make the changes you need through the right channels, when all the
channels have been broken, and blocked, when people have no good
choices any more, then people need to make some bad-ass choices. Me. I
am gonna make some bad-ass choices."

Rob gave her a solid side eye. "What do mean 'bad-ass choices', Love?"

"These old white guys, they're never going to understand, unless things
get a whole lot more real for them. I don't know what that means, yet,
but let's have the Nelsons over for dinner next weekend or the weekend
after, and come up with some plans."

"OK ... OK, I trust you. Let's have a good a dinner, uncork a good
bottle of wine, and talk about some bad-ass choices."


.. note:: Still February 2015

Maritta Lewis lay on the examination bed. A tear broke free from one of
her eyes, and cascaded down her cheek.

Louise Nelson squeezed her hand. "You're going to be fine," Louise
whispered.

"You _are_ going to be fine," Dr Bruce Howard confirmed. He pointed at
the monitor. "And your little squiggle is looking perfectly healthy."

Maritta's chest clenched as she suppressed a sob.

"Doctor?" asked Louise, trying to distract the three of them from weight
of the atmosphere in the small room.

"Yes, Louise?"

"That newspaper clipping on the wall. What is that about?"

"Oh, yah, that was pretty cool." Bruce smiled. "I don't know if you can
place my accent, but I'm from South Africa. I used to practise at a big
public hospital in Cape Town. I performed a C-section at six months, on
a woman who had an ectopic pregnancy. Her fallopian tube had ruptured,
and the placenta had attached to her kidney."

"Jesus!" gasped Louise. "That must have been agonizing!"

"Yah, I can't imagine. She lived in a township, and she didn't see a
doctor because doctors cost money, so she thought she would just power
through."

"Oh my God!"

"You see, the kidney provided the placenta all the blood and nutrients
that the fetus needed. But the mother's pre-eclampsia got too much,
and so she came through to the hospital. You know, it's very, very
uncomfortable, and painful, and it messes with your digestive tract. We
did an emergency C-section, and the baby made it! It made the news. So.
Yah. That was my fifteen minutes of fame," grinned Bruce.

"Wow." Louise exchaled. Abdominal pregnancy. That's insane.


.. note:: March 2015

Louise leaned in over the dinner table. "I was thinking we could call it
the 'Family Defense Foundation'. Firstly, because anything with the
word 'family' in it sounds like a right-wing dog whistle. And secondly,
because the truth is that the majority of women who get abortions have
a family."

"I love it," said Katherine Nelson. "Let's do it."

"The Family Defense Foundation!" James Nelson raised his glass.

The four of them chinked, and took another of many sips.
