The Gun in the Safe
===================

.. note:: Tuesday morning, December 27, 2022

When Louise arrived, Herman was already sitting at a small table, with a
cup of coffee in front of him. He waved to her, and a waiter followed
her to the table.

"A long black with almond milk, please."

"Would that be all ma'am?" the waiter asked. "We do have fresh carrot
cake this morning."

"Yeah that sounds lovely," said Louise.

After the waiter had left, Herman looked at her for a while. He looked
like he was about to say something, and Louise waited for him to say it.

"Thank you for join me," he said eventually, "both in person, and, you
know---"

"Well," interrupted Louise, "I kinda feel the same way. Thank you for
joining me. You're the one making a greater effort here."

"Yeah," agreed Herman, "let's just acknowledge that I'm essentially
sitting down for coffee with my rapist."

"Activist, willing to resort to violence to make a point," Louise tried
to clarify.

"Violence that can result in pregnancy. Life-threatening pregnancy, to
be clear. Double-life-threatening." Herman looked at her fixedly.

Louise held eye contact. "Right," she said after a pause.

Herman's expression softened. "How did we get here?"

"Where? You mean how did we end up in a world where a woman no longer
gets to make her own decisions about her own body, in the Land of the
Free?" Louise's uncertainty showed in the frown on her forehead.

"No, no," Herman didn't mean that at all, "I mean you and me. We've
been friends since you were in Law School, Louise. This whole thing,
this thing you did to me, you must have planned this for a long
time. You said something about Bill Palatine's P.A.. Is that the moment
when I could no longer trust you?"

Louise thought about it, "That wasn't really about you. That was just
the start of what has taken us to where we are now. Her name is
Maritta. Something her OBGYN said planted the seed of an idea. It took
seven years to get from that idea to your unwelcome parasite."

"Talk me through that." requested Herman.

"OK, on one condition."

"Let me guess: it's not admissible."

"We're both lawyers," smiled Louise.

"Yeah, look, whoever else is involved in this, they're not going to be
incriminated by this conversation. There are going to be witnesses,
cameras, plenty of solid evidence. This conversation is just for our
sake. I just want to know what I don't know."

"OK," agreed Louise.

"---And another thing," Herman broke in before she could answer his
question. "Obviously our friendship can never be the same. You are not
the person I thought you were, or this is a side of you I never knew
was there. But I want to know who you really are. I don't just want to
know what happened, what you hid from me for seven years you say. Who
are you? I'm not writing you off. You are important, to me. I'm doing
this for you. I'm doing a hard thing."

Louise looked him in the eye. "We disagree about stuff. Some pretty
basic stuff, like how to interpret the Constitution, and God, and what
'freedom'means. But you are fundamentally a good person, Herman. Thank
you. Thank you for making the effort, for me. So. Should I begin?"

Louise and Rob sat opposite James and Katherine Nelson. The remains of a
cheese board lay on the table. A small plate and a knife sat on front
of each of them, and a glass with red wine in it.

"So what you're saying is," clarified James, "that this baby grew off a
kidney, and it was healthy." James was a mechanical engineer, and he and
Rob worked together at an engineering consultancy.

"Yeah! To be clear," said Louise, "ectopic pregnancies are life
threatening. They are terminated as soon as they are discovered. But
here's a woman who pushed through chronic pain, and had a healthy baby."

"That is fucking insane," said Katherine. Katherine was a matron in a
hospital. She was responsible for everything that happened in her ward.
So when she described something medical as "fucking insane", you must
know that she had seen some shit, and she was not exaggerating.

"Is it though?" goaded Louise. "On a scale of 1 to 10, how insane would
it be?"

"At least a 9." Katherine was pretty sure.

"OK. Then I'm going to give you an 11." Louise was priming her audience.

"OK?"

"How do we make a congressman pregnant?" Louise asked?

"A male congressman?" checked Katherine.

"A congressman without a uterus, yes." Louise confirmed.

"Look, firstly, yes, that's an 11. Also, no. The blastocyte isn't going
to attach. Male bodies just don't have the hormones. Nothing's going to
trigger the progesterone you need. You can't keep the blastocyte alive.
It'll just get expelled. Also ... are you fucking crazy?"

"Hey," defended Louise, "these guys are never going to get it. How can
they? Look where they come from. 'Good ol' boys'? The 'kind of man you
can have a beer with'?" Louise made scare quotes with her fingers. "We
all know that means, right? It means the kind of guy who reckons 'the
ladyfolk' are unfathomable. So why would a man ever even try to
understand what it's like to have an invader inside you?---Did any of
you ever do philosophy at college?"

A round of "no"s.

"OK," Louise started, "so here is a thought experiment we covered in my
freshman year of Philosophy 101. Picture this: You wake up in a
hospital. You try to sit up, but you realise you are handcuffed to your
bed. Then you notice that there are tubes running from you to the bed
next to you, and in that bed is Mitch McConnell. You start shouting for
a nurse, and in walks, uh, Katherine, who's a nurse on your ward?"

"Tom Fieldgate. Big guy. Sound like the right guy for this thought
experiment," Katherine says.

"Perfect." Louise continues, "Tom Fieldgate walks in. You're like 'Hey!
What the fuck? Why am I here? Why are there tubes connecting me to
Mitch McConnell?' And Tom explains to you that Mitch McConnell has some
condition where only your blood can keep him alive. Nobody else's blood
will do. So if you disconnect him, it's murder. Right? So it's like
pregnancy. The question is, do you have a right to unplug him?"

"Well, it's a little worse than that," said Katherine, "because it
sounds like your hospital bed is quite a safe environment. Being
connected to Mitch McConnell probably has about a zero chance of
killing you. That's not true for a pregnancy, where you've got a
non-zero chance of bad things happening."

"Right! But all this is completely hypothetical for most legislators.
Just an interesting thought experiment that they'll never need to
actually engage with. Oh, and of course, if I was talking to different
people, maybe I'd have chosen Chuck Schumer, but that's just a
distraction. The point is, is bodily autonomy a right? And unless they
wake up handcuffed to the bed and tubefeeding someone else using their
own body, they will never know. So I'm proposing we make if real for
them. Very real. One of their own."

"OK. You've got a point. But it's never going to work," said
Katherine.

Rob spoke up, "Maybe. You see, 'never going to work' sounds like a
challenge to me. That sounds like an engineering problem. And James and
I know all about those. That's what we do. Plus, you're a matron. You
can get the things we need. Maybe you can even ask doctors questions,
in a round-about way, and solve some of the problems we're going to
encounter."

"I don't know guys. This sounds like a career ender. This sounds like
jail time, and like it's seriously going to backfire. No, this is just
an all-round bad idea."

"OK, how about this," proposed Louise. "We figure out how to do it. And
if we ever need it, we'll have it in our back pocket. Like a gun in a
gun safe. We don't want to use it, but if we ever need it, then it's
there."

"A fun side-project," Rob supported Louise.

"Cos you can see what McConnell is like with Obama." Louise was
prescient. "He and the Republicans block Obama on absolutely everything.
If Obama gets a chance to nominate a new justice, they're going to do
everything they can to block him. And then what? If a Republican wins
the presidency, Roe v. Wade might be on the line. Bodily autonomy is
nowhere in the consititution. Did you know that several states
differentiate between rape, and rape of a spouse? In California, and in
South Carolina, if you have too much to drink, and your spouse has sex
with you against your will, that's not a crime. But if anyone else has
sex with you against your will, then it is. Nothing in the Constitution
protects our bodily autonomy. All we have to rely on is a decision by
the Supreme Court essentially about privacy, and what if they take that
away?"

"What about Precedent?" asked Katherine.

"Yeah. You're right, that should mean something. But these theocrats,
Katherine. The religious right are carrying the Republicans---all those
single-issue voters. And if they can turn the court, they're not going
to give a shit about Precedent. It needs to be in the Constitution. It
is, in practically every other free country. Because of course it is.
And it's never going to happen in this country as long as legislators
think women are their baby factories. I'm telling you. Somehow, they
need to know, really know, what it means to be violated by something
that depends on them for its life. Then, oh my god, they'll turn on a
dime."


.. note:: June 2016

"What did I tell you?!" Louise shouted at Rob, Katherine and James,
over the same table where they had discussed what they would
subsequently refer to as "The Gun in the Safe". It was three months
since Obama nominated Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court. Mitch
McConnell had blocked all action that could move the nomination forward.

Katherine enrolled in a course on obstetrics.

James enrolled in a course on vetinary science.

Rob and Louise started keeping pigs. James learned how to perform
artificial insemination. Katherine learned how to harvest ova, and to
perform in vitro fertilization. The four of them would meet up every
week, and share with each other what they had learned. Rob converted
his and Louise's basement into a surgery. The four of them started
experimenting with placing blastocytes in gauze pads, exposing them
to progesterone, and then placing the pads against the kidney of a live
pig. They learned how to fold and unfold the pad. James built a surgical
instrument that looked a little like tongs that could seal the pad as
it was inserted, and then open it and push it against the kidney once
it was inserted all the way. They learned how to make the incision
smaller and smaller.

If prose could have a montage, this is where you'd find one.


.. note:: September 2020

After the death of Ruth Bader Ginsburg, President Donald Trump nominated
Louise Newton's long-time friend, Herman Crowbell to the Supreme
Court.

Louise kept having dreams of being caught in a hurricane. Herman would
be holding her hand, and praying fervently. And then she would hear the
words he was saying, and she would realise that he was calling upon God
to make the storm rage harder.


.. note:: October 2020

Years ago the group had realized that, at some point, they would need to
test their procedure with a human blastocyte.

The Crowbells held a dinner party at their home on the Saturday after
Herman's swearing-in ceremony, to celebrate. Rob and Louise were
invited. When the two of them got home afterwards, Louise spoke to Rob,
and then texted the Nelsons, to let them know that she wanted to
volunteer her own ova.
