The Gun in the Safe
===================

.. note:: Wednesday morning, December 21, 2022

Speaking to Jonathan Whittaker-Innes had made a huge difference to
Herman Crowbell. It gave him a sense of agency. He wasn't just a victim
of a violent crime. He now had a purpose: To wrestle back the public
narrative, and to play the role of champion of the rights of the
unborn.

Spurred by this growing feeling of confidence, he decided to call
Louise.

"Hi Herman," Louise answerd her cellphone.

"Hi Louise," said Herman. He waited.

"I guess this is suddenly all very real for you now," she said.

"Well, I have certainly learned a lot about you," Herman stated.

"What have you learned?" asked Louise.

"First up," started Herman, "I learned that I can't trust you, that you
are not my friend, and you probably never were."

"That's not true." Louise stopped him.

"What? Friends don't rape friends, Louise."

"It's more complicated than that, Herman. I would leave it there, but
you are a smart man, and so, if you're interested, I can unpack this
for you."

"Sure," prompted Herman. "Please tell me how drugging someone, cutting
them open, implanting them with a baby, and then lying to them about
it, is something that someone can do to their friend."

"OK. Well. I have a lot of respect for you, Herman. I think despite the
way left-wing media portrayed you during your Supreme Court nomination
process, you are a fundamentally good person. I like you, and I care
about you. And I would hope that over the years you have known me, that
I've made my feelings clear to you. That has never been a lie."

"You say that Louise, but you are what you do. Look at what you've
done." Herman pointed out, "That's a contradiction. Even if I wanted to
believe you, your actions speak so much louder than these platitudes."

"Yeah. We are all complex people. There is something that is more
important to me than our friendship, and that is the lives and
well-being of thousands of women and their families, that you are
destroying with the Dobbs decision. Despite how much I care about you,
Herman, I need you to have a real understanding of what your decision
means. Do you think that people should have the right to decide what
they do with their own bodies? Or do you think only the government gets
to decide?"

"We've talked about this before, Louise," Herman reminded her. "You're a
lawyer. It's obvious to the both of us that countries need laws. People
can't murder people."

"It's not a person. And even if it was, it doesn't have the right to
your body."

"OK. Wait." Herman took a breath. "Before we do this, can we step back?"

"Sure," said Louise.

"Why me?" asked Herman. "If I'm your friend, why do this to me? Why not
one of the other justices?"

"We didn't think it would have been possible to do this to one of the
others. You were our only option. And please believe me when I say that
this was not easy for me."

"I wasn't your only option. There is also Bill Palatine of South
Carolina."

"Actually he was the one who started this all off," Louise divulged.

"How?"

"I represented his P.A., who he got pregnant, and tried to cover up.
Like, abortions should be illegal for his constituents, but not for
him. They're always happy to fuck up other people's lives, but the
rules---the rules that they wrote---those rules never apply to
themselves."

"OK. So you decided to impregnate us, one hypocritical congressman and
one Supreme Court justice. And you think that's going to change things."

"Well so far, nothing else has worked, has it?" Louise asked
rhetorically.

"What are you hoping for, Louise. What is your best-case scenario?"
Herman was pretty sure she hadn't thought this through very well.

"Look at the Republicans in Congress. Look at the judges they nominate.
Almost all of them have bodily autonomy all of the time. They can't fall
pregnant. A fight between men is not the same as being raped---the
power differential, the humilitation, the subjugation. It's right there
in the Ten Commandments: 'Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's wife.'
Men have rights; women are property. Anyway, I wanted all those
legislators and judges to feel real empathy for their brothers, like for
someone in their in-group. If they feel a sense of loss of a right that
they have never lost before, maybe then they will enshrine that right
into law." Louise hoped that she had explained herself well enough.

"OK," said Herman. "For the record, I'm going to carry this baby until
it's delivered, hopefully alive. But I suspect you may get your wish.
You're also going to go to jail."

"Probably. My going to jail will give the political right a feeling of
retribution. But it will only make me more of a hero to the left."

"Hmmm," thought Herman, "You know what bothers me?"

"What?" asked Louise.

"You're thinking about this like it's a binary option. You all are.
Pro-life. Pro-choice. Either or. But that's not what's happening here.
Yeah, we should all have bodily autonomy. But also, if you look at a
baby born after 7 months, you can see it's a little person. We
instinctively know that it's not OK to put it down like an old dog."

"Where are you going with this, Herman?" Louise was suspicious.

"I'm saying I believe you, Louise. But I'm also right. We are both
right. And the law needs to recognize that. Will you ..." suddenly
Herman found himself struggling.

"Will I?" Louise felt the anticipation.

Herman was considering collaborating with his rapist. If he paused any
longer, he'd freeze. So he pushed ahead.

"... work with me. I want to do the right thing. And you want to do the
right thing. I know that I'm right in my way. And I believe that you're
right in your way. I disagree with your methods, of course, but I
understand your motivation. So, uh, would you ... collaborate with me.
It would be really powerful, a really powerful message, if we publicly
came together, and advocated for an amendment that respected the rights
of both the mother and the fetus, and provided a framework for weighing
competing rights against each other. Maybe bodily autonomy until a
fetus is viable, and then the rights of personhood take precendence?
Something like that?"

"So, um," thought Louise, "are you saying that you're not going to press
charges?"

Herman considered this, "I don't know. I'm going to have to think about
that." And then he added, "Would you work with me if I did? Press
charges I mean?"

"Yes. I would. Sending me to prison would only hurt your cause, and
benefit my objectives. But I think you're right: Working together would
be amazing. For both of us. We can talk about how I think personhood
works some other time, but we can't get bogged down in philosophy. I
think together we can get more good out of this very complicated
situation than I ever imagined," said Louise.

"Thank you," said Herman. "I think it will take a while for me to
process this -- this has been a wild, scary, traumatic ride you've put
me on, Louise. But I'm actually feeling a little positive. Maybe."

"Me too, Herman," Louise echoed. "In fact, this is blowing my mind a
little. Thank you. I can't say how much this means to me."

"Yeah, I've been struggling with words ever since I found out what
happened. As much as I know what happened."

"Yeah, we can talk about all that later," said Louise.

"OK. OK, then. Well, bye Louise." Herman wrapped up the call.

"Yes. OK. Bye Herman." Louise took the phone from her ear, and pressed
the hangup button.

"Jesus," she said to herself. "What the fuck?" She went to her contacts,
pressed "Rob", and after a couple of seconds, said, "Babes. Babes, you
will not believe what just happened."


.. note:: Tuesday morning, December 27, 2022

When Louise arrived, Herman was already sitting at a small table, with a
cup of coffee in front of him. He waved to her, and a waiter followed
her to the table.

"A long black with almond milk, please."

"Would that be all ma'am?" the waiter asked. "We do have fresh carrot
cake this morning."

"Yeah that sounds lovely," said Louise.

After the waiter had left, Herman looked at her for a while. He looked
like he was about to say something, and Louise waited for him to say it.

"Thank you for join me," he said eventually, "both in person, and, you
know---"

"Well," interrupted Louise, "I kinda feel the same way. Thank you for
joining me. You're the one making a greater effort here."

"Yeah," agreed Herman, "let's just acknowledge that I'm essentially
sitting down for coffee with my rapist."

"Activist, willing to resort to violence to make a point," Louise tried
to clarify.

"Violence that can result in pregnancy. Life-threatening pregnancy, to
be clear. Double-life-threatening." Herman looked at her fixedly.

Louise held eye contact. "Right," she said after a pause.

Herman's expression softened. "How did we get here?"

"Where? You mean how did we end up in a world where a woman no longer
gets to make her own decisions about her own body, in the Land of the
Free?" Louise's uncertainty showed in the frown on her forehead.

"No, no," Herman didn't mean that at all, "I mean you and me. We've
been friends since you were in Law School, Louise. This whole thing,
this thing you did to me, you must have planned this for a long
time. You said something about Bill Palatine's P.A.. Is that the moment
when I could no longer trust you?"

Louise thought about it, "That wasn't really about you. That was just
the start of what has taken us to where we are now. Her name is
Maritta. Something her OBGYN said planted the seed of an idea. It took
seven years to get from that idea to your unwelcome parasite."

"Talk me through that." requested Herman.

"OK, on one condition."

"Let me guess: it's not admissible."

"We're both lawyers," smiled Louise.

"Yeah, look, whoever else is involved in this, they're not going to be
incriminated by this conversation. There are going to be witnesses,
cameras, plenty of solid evidence. This conversation is just for our
sake. I just want to know what I don't know."

"OK," agreed Louise.

"---And another thing," Herman broke in before she could answer his
question. "Obviously our friendship can never be the same. You are not
the person I thought you were, or this is a side of you I never knew
was there. But I want to know who you really are. I don't just want to
know what happened, what you hid from me for seven years you say. Who
are you? I'm not writing you off. You are important, to me. I'm doing
this for you. I'm doing a hard thing."

Louise looked him in the eye. "We disagree about stuff. Some pretty
basic stuff, like how to interpret the Constitution, and God, and what
'freedom'means. But you are fundamentally a good person, Herman. Thank
you. Thank you for making the effort, for me. So. Should I begin?"


.. note:: May 2015

Louise and Rob sat opposite James and Katherine Nelson. The remains of a
cheese board lay on the table. A small plate and a knife sat on front
of each of them, and a glass with red wine in it.

"So what you're saying is," clarified James, "that this baby grew off a
kidney, and it was healthy." James was a mechanical engineer, and he and
Rob worked together at an engineering consultancy.

"Yeah! To be clear," said Louise, "ectopic pregnancies are life
threatening. They are terminated as soon as they are discovered. But
here's a woman who pushed through chronic pain, and had a healthy baby."

"That is fucking insane," said Katherine. Katherine was a matron in a
hospital. She was responsible for everything that happened in her ward.
So when she described something medical as "fucking insane", you must
know that she had seen some shit, and she was not exaggerating.

"Is it though?" goaded Louise. "On a scale of 1 to 10, how insane would
it be?"

"At least a 9." Katherine was pretty sure.

"OK. Then I'm going to give you an 11." Louise was priming her audience.

"OK?"

"How do we make a congressman pregnant?" Louise asked?

"A male congressman?" checked Katherine.

"A congressman without a uterus, yes." Louise confirmed.

"Look, firstly, yes, that's an 11. Also, no. The blastocyte isn't going
to attach. Male bodies just don't have the hormones. Nothing's going to
trigger the progesterone you need. You can't keep the blastocyte alive.
It'll just get expelled. Also ... are you fucking crazy?"

"Hey," defended Louise, "these guys are never going to get it. How can
they? Look where they come from. 'Good ol' boys'? The 'kind of man you
can have a beer with'?" Louise made scare quotes with her fingers. "We
all know that means, right? It means the kind of guy who reckons 'the
ladyfolk' are unfathomable. So why would a man ever even try to
understand what it's like to have an invader inside you?---Did any of
you ever do philosophy at college?"

A round of "no"s.

"OK," Louise started, "so here is a thought experiment we covered in my
freshman year of Philosophy 101. Picture this: You wake up in a
hospital. You try to sit up, but you realise you are handcuffed to your
bed. Then you notice that there are tubes running from you to the bed
next to you, and in that bed is Mitch McConnell. You start shouting for
a nurse, and in walks, uh, Katherine, who's a nurse on your ward?"

"Tom Fieldgate. Big guy. Sound like the right guy for this thought
experiment," Katherine says.

"Perfect." Louise continues, "Tom Fieldgate walks in. You're like 'Hey!
What the fuck? Why am I here? Why are there tubes connecting me to
Mitch McConnell?' And Tom explains to you that Mitch McConnell has some
condition where only your blood can keep him alive. Nobody else's blood
will do. So if you disconnect him, it's murder. Right? So it's like
pregnancy. The question is, do you have a right to unplug him?"

"Well, it's a little worse than that," said Katherine, "because it
sounds like your hospital bed is quite a safe environment. Being
connected to Mitch McConnell probably has about a zero chance of
killing you. That's not true for a pregnancy, where you've got a
non-zero chance of bad things happening."

"Right! But all this is completely hypothetical for most legislators.
Just an interesting thought experiment that they'll never need to
actually engage with. Oh, and of course, if I was talking to different
people, maybe I'd have chosen Chuck Schumer, but that's just a
distraction. The point is, is bodily autonomy a right? And unless they
wake up handcuffed to the bed and tubefeeding someone else using their
own body, they will never know. So I'm proposing we make if real for
them. Very real. One of their own."

"OK. You've got a point. But it's never going to work," said
Katherine.

Rob spoke up, "Maybe. You see, 'never going to work' sounds like a
challenge to me. That sounds like an engineering problem. And James and
I know all about those. That's what we do. Plus, you're a matron. You
can get the things we need. Maybe you can even ask doctors questions,
in a round-about way, and solve some of the problems we're going to
encounter."

"I don't know guys. This sounds like a career ender. This sounds like
jail time, and like it's seriously going to backfire. No, this is just
an all-round bad idea."

"OK, how about this," proposed Louise. "We figure out how to do it. And
if we ever need it, we'll have it in our back pocket. Like a gun in a
gun safe. We don't want to use it, but if we ever need it, then it's
there."

"A fun side-project," Rob supported Louise.

"Cos you can see what McConnell is like with Obama." Louise was
prescient. "He and the Republicans block Obama on absolutely everything.
If Obama gets a chance to nominate a new justice, they're going to do
everything they can to block him. And then what? If a Republican wins
the presidency, Roe v. Wade might be on the line. Bodily autonomy is
nowhere in the consititution. Did you know that several states
differentiate between rape, and rape of a spouse? In California, and in
South Carolina, if you have too much to drink, and your spouse has sex
with you against your will, that's not a crime. But if anyone else has
sex with you against your will, then it is. Nothing in the Constitution
protects our bodily autonomy. All we have to rely on is a decision by
the Supreme Court essentially about privacy, and what if they take that
away?"

"What about Precedent?" asked Katherine.

"Yeah. You're right, that should mean something. But these theocrats,
Katherine. The religious right are carrying the Republicans---all those
single-issue voters. And if they can turn the court, they're not going
to give a shit about Precedent. It needs to be in the Constitution. It
is, in practically every other free country. Because of course it is.
And it's never going to happen in this country as long as legislators
think women are their baby factories. I'm telling you. Somehow, they
need to know, really know, what it means to be violated by something
that depends on them for its life. Then, oh my god, they'll turn on a
dime."


.. note:: June 2016

"What did I tell you?!" Louise shouted at Rob, Katherine and James,
over the same table where they had discussed what they would
subsequently refer to as "The Gun in the Safe". It was three months
since Obama nominated Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court. Mitch
McConnell had blocked all action that could move the nomination forward.

Katherine enrolled in a course on obstetrics.

James enrolled in a course on vetinary science.

Rob and Louise started keeping pigs. James learned how to perform
artificial insemination. Katherine learned how to harvest ova, and to
perform in vitro fertilization. The four of them would meet up every
week, and share with each other what they had learned. Rob converted
his and Louise's basement into a surgery. The four of them started
experimenting with placing blastocytes in gauze pads, exposing them
to progesterone, and then placing the pads against the kidney of a live
pig. They learned how to fold and unfold the pad. James built a surgical
instrument that looked a little like tongs that could seal the pad as
it was inserted, and then open it and push it against the kidney once
it was inserted all the way. They learned how to make the incision
smaller and smaller.

If prose could have a montage, this is where you'd find one.


.. note:: September 2020

After the death of Ruth Bader Ginsburg, President Donald Trump nominated
Louise Newton's long-time friend, Herman Crowbell to the Supreme
Court.

Louise kept having dreams of being caught in a hurricane. Herman would
be holding her hand, and praying fervently. And then she would hear the
words he was saying, and she would realise that he was calling upon God
to make the storm rage harder.


.. note:: October 2020

Years ago the group had realized that, at some point, they would need to
test their procedure with a human blastocyte.

The Crowbells held a dinner party at their home on the Saturday after
Herman's swearing-in ceremony, to celebrate. Rob and Louise were
invited. When the two of them got home afterwards, Louise spoke to Rob,
and then texted the Nelsons, to let them know that she wanted to
volunteer her own ova.
