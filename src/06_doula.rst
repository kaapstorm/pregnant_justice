"Hi there, you must be Molly Keith."

"Hello, and you are Justice Herman Crowbell."

"Come in, and please call me Herman."

Molly stepped into the judge's home, and Herman lead her into the
livingroom, where his wife stood up from a sofa.

"Gwin," he said, "this is Molly Keith. She is the doula that Dr Buchanan
referred me to. Molly, this is my wife, Gwin."

"Please to meet you, Gwin," Molly extended her hand, and Gwin Crowbell
shook it.

"A pleasure to meet you too. Keith, you say?"

"Yes."

"That's Scottish, right?"

"You wouldn't say by looking at me," grinned Molly, who was obviously
African-American, "but I think so. My father's father was born in Nova
Scotia."

"Well, my maiden name is Leslie," said Gwin, "and the Leslie Clan is
nextdoor neighbors with the Keith Clan. I have visited Dunnottar Castle,
the castle of your grandfather's ancestors."

"Oh, really? What's it like?"

"It's spectacular. It's on top of a cliff, against the sea, in the north
east of Scotland."

"That sounds awesome. I'll have to go and visit it."

"Oh you definitely should. You have a proud history," smiled Gwin.

That sounded a little racist, thought Molly, as if it was the Scottish
nobility that deserved pride, as opposed to the generation struggles of
her other ancestors, but she understood that Gwin didn't mean it like
that.

As if reading her thoughts, Herman said, "Well my Love, Ms Keith has a
lot of other things to be proud of too. Dr. Buchanan praised Molly
highly." Turning to Molly, he continued, "I believe that you didn't
start off as a doula, you were a professor of midwifry before."

"Yes, that's right."

"Why the change in career?"

"Trust me, it is very difficult to walk away from tenure. But really
there were two things that pulled me, dragged me even." She laughed.
"People need good midwives, that is certain, but we need doulas even
more. Western medicine has a long history of focusing on the physical,
mechanical aspects of health, and not enough emphasis on our emotional,
psychological, and social wellbeing. Practicing as a doula is how I get
better at that, and improve our community. And maybe one day I might
go back into academia and lecture on this, but I'm not yet convinced
it's the right environment. Maybe I'll start a school more like a
guild, with apprentices. Being a good doula is all about the soft
skills, not the mechanics."

"Take a seat, take a seat," Herman invited.

"Thank you." Molly sat on the sofa next to Gwin, and Herman sat in an
armchair on Gwin's other side. "First off," Molly began, "I want to say
what an honor this is. I think you are doing a very brave thing,
Herman."

Herman smiled, "Well, I didn't choose my circumstances, but I'm doing
my best to rise to them."

"You're doing amazingly so far. And I'm hoping that together we can
keep it up.

"But before we get to the good parts of what I'm here for," Molly
continued, "we do need to address some important chemistry. Are you on
any kind of progesterone therapy?"

"Uh," Herman frowned, "I would know if I was, right?"

"Yeah, you would know." Molly said. "You'd be taking a daily pill, or
wearing a patch."

"OK. I'm not doing those, so I guess I'm not on progesterone therapy."

"Alright. Progesterone is a hormone that your fetus needs for
development. So I'm going to give you a bunch of patches. You're going
to put the first one on your thigh in a minute. Every two days you put
a new one on, and you leave each one on for eight days.

That sounds like it will get complicated, but it's not that bad. After 8
days you'll end up with four at a time. Just put them in a ring around
your thigh, and once you have four, pull the oldest one off when you
put a new one on. Does that make sense?"

"Yeah," confirmed Herman, "Put on a new patch every two days. I'll
diarize it. Once I have four, swap the oldest one out."

"You got it." Molly pulled a pink box out of her bag, and gave it to
Herman. "You can put the first one on now. Let me know if you'd like a
hand."

"Here or in the bathroom?"

"I don't mind," said Molly. "In the next few months we're going to get
to know each other very, very well, so I'm fine with here, if you're
fine with here."

"I guess now is a good time to start getting comfortable," Herman
reckoned. He opened the box, pulled out a sachet, and tore it open.
Inside was a patch with a back that you peal off. He dropped his
trousers, pealed off the back, and stuck the patch on his upper thigh,
just below his boxers. Then he pulled his trousers back up.

"Nice," smiled Molly. "Now let's talk about you, and Gwin, and the next
year, and five years after that, and ten years after that."

Herman didn't know that doulas dealt with teenagers. He and Gwin leaned
forward.

"Obviously your pregnancy is the first time a man has been pregnant.

"There is a lot that we just don't know, and you are our guinea pig. But
there are a few things that we suspect. Fetal sex development involves
hormone signalling between the mother and the fetus, and your body is
probably not going to do that. So the chances seem quite high that your
baby will have what's called 'DSD' or 'Different Sex Development'. It's
what used to be called 'Intersex', or the 'I' in 'LGBTQIA plus'."

"Uhm," interrupted Herman, "so you're saying our baby might be gay?"

"Not exactly. 'Gay' means a man who is sexually attracted to men. I
don't know who your child will be attracted to. DSD means a person with
XX chromosomes whose genitals don't look typical of female genitals, or
whose uterus or ovaries have not developed typically, or similarly a
person with XY chromosomes whose penis might be shorter or hooded with
labia, or whose testes and scrotum have not developed fully."

"Is that like non-binary?" Herman was trying to find a box to categorize
this new information.

"Again, not quite. 'Non-binary' refers to a gender, and gender is in
our heads. Sex is in our pants. In the medical community there is a lot
of talk about this, because we need a language everyone agrees on in
order to accurately communicate ideas and decisions. My understanding of
these words, and the understanding of professionals in many
institutions and practices, is that sex refers to physical properties,
like chromosomes and organs, and gender refers to psychological
properties, like what you experience, and what you do. So the genitals
you have are determined by your sex, and the clothes you choose to wear
are determined by your gender."

"OK. I think I've got it. We don't know what gender our baby will be.
But we think the baby's sex organs might look not quite male, or not
quite female." Herman checked with Molly.

"Exactly," said Molly. "If this turns out to be the case, it will affect
your child, and you. It is a rare condition, but not uncommon.
Historically, doctors tried to use surgery to shape the genitals to look
more typical. This is almost always what parents have wanted. But
often, in fact a lot more often than not, it is not what the children
have wanted, as they grew up.

"Fortunately for your baby, they will be born into a society that is a
lot more accepting of differences. They can be happy, and find loving,
fulfilling relationships, regardless of the sex organs they are born
with."

"Won't they get beaten up at school?" Herman remembered that kids can be
savage and brutal.

"My advice then," smirked Molly, "is not to send your child to the
school you went to. The truth is, if you tell children what is normal,
what is accepatable, they will believe you.---What school did you go to,
Herman?"

"Avon," said Herman, assuming Molly knew it.

Molly thought she did, "That's boys-only, in Hartford, right?"

"Best school in Connecticut," confirmed Herman.

Molly didn't think so. "Yeah, if your baby has XY chromosomes, and can
pass as a boy by the age of 15, I would not recommend Avon. No, let me
put that differently: I will come back here, and shout at you, as loud
as I can, for as long as I can, until you put him down for a different
school."

"Why, what's wrong with Avon?" Herman's loyalties were being tested.

"Are you kidding me?" Molly put on her most theatrical frown, "a boys'
school for a kid with DSD? Are you sure he won't try to leave early,
with a belt around his neck?"

"Jesus, Molly. OK." Herman conceded.

"OK great." Molly dropped the frown immediately, to demonstrate that it
was for show, and that she only meant well. "No boys' schools. And
oviously, no girls' schools, right?"

Herman looked at his wife. Gwin nodded her agreement with Molly. "OK. No
girls' schools."

"OK. There's one more thing about schools. Your child is going to need a
school that is accepting of all kinds of people."

"Of course. Avon isn't cheap, but they have African-Americans and
Asian-Americans, and anyone who can either afford it, or get a bursary.
I'm sure any school worthy of our kid will accept all kinds of people."
Herman noticed Molly's face. "That's not what you mean, is it?"

Molly laughed, "No."

"Oh, I get it. You mean 'woke'." Herman grinned like it was a joke.

Molly looked at him, mulling her next sentence. "I would ask you to
define what you mean by that, but you're going to fuck it up. So let's
rather skip that. I mean a 'liberal' school. In the John Stuart Mill
sense, right? The Thomas Jefferson sense. _Not_ the Tucker Carlson
sense. A school where kids can be whoever they want to be. It's easy
to spot these schools. When you go for the interview with the head
teacher, look around. If the kids look like they just walked off the
set of 'Fame', you're in the right place."

Herman grinned, "I appreciate the cultural reference. OK. So our child
is going to be different, and they will need a school where everyone is
different."

"Yes! Exactly," said Molly.

"What group will they be in, do you think?" asked Gwin.

"What group were you in?" asked Molly.

"I was with the sporty girls."

"Maybe they'll be sporty." Molly guessed.

She broadened the subject. "The bigger picture here is that your child
might be different, and you're going to need to adapt. And of course,
you're already going through stuff that's wildly different, and new. Are
you keeping a diary?"

Herman said, "No. I haven't kept a diary since I was a teenager. My best
friend found it, and, well, I stopped keeping a diary after that."

"Keep a diary." Molly suggested. "Write it for public consumption. And
especially for a medical and scientific audience. I'd like to publish on
this. You should too, but for a general audience. And also keep a second
diary, but that one should be for only you and your wife, and, when
they're old enough, your child.

"Herman," Molly looked him right in the eyes. "I appreciate that you're
having this baby because you feel it's the right thing to do. But this
baby is more important than that. More significant. Have this baby for
humanity. We're all going to be taking meaning from this. What it means
to be a woman. What it means to be a man. The duties that fall to us.
The honors given to us. It's about so, so much more than you, Herman.
Have you thought about that?"

"Not the way you put that, no," Herman admitted. "But I will."


.. the next morning
.. note:: Friday, December 23, 2022

Herman woke up feeling nauseous. He wandered into the bathroom, and had
a glass of water. Then he dragged himself downstairs, and put on the
coffee. It smelled disgusting.

He went back upstairs. "Gwinny?"

His wife looked up from her phone.

"Gwinny, I think there is something wrong with the coffee machine. The
coffee smells bad."

She gave him a skeptical look. Then she got out of bed, walked
downstairs, and smelled the coffee. "It's fine," she said to herself.

She waited until there was enough coffee in the jug, and poured them
both a cup. She added milk. Then she took both cups back upstairs.

Herman looked at his cup. "No. Can't you smell it?"

"Smell what?" asked Gwin.

"It's off."

Gwin took a sip. "It's a good cup of coffee."

"I can't," said Herman, but he raised it to his lips out of curiosity.
He took a tiny taste. "Urgh. Urgh, no. ... Oh, crap."

He launched himself into the bathroom, spilling some coffee on the
bedside table as he hurredly set the cup aside. He lifted the toilet
lid, and threw up.

"Fuck. It's these fucking hormones, isn't it?"

Gwin knelt down beside him, and put her arm around him. She was making a
conscious effort to show her support, because inside her head, a
thought had appeared. It wasn't unkind, but it wasn't kind. It
went, "Yeah. Finally. There is one man on this planet who knows what
morning sickness is like." And then she had a second, kinder
thought: "My man."

After Herman had brushed his teeth, and gargled with mouthwash to get
rid of any lingering taste, he called Molly. "Hi Molly, it's Herman.

"Yeah, not so well actually. I just threw up. I haven't done that before.

"Yeah, yeah, I'll put it in my diary. It's just, I'm sure it's because
of this progesterone patch, because it didn't happen yesterday morning.
So I was wondering, are you sure I need four of them?

"Right.

"Right.

"Right. OK. Four it is.

"Yeah. I will. OK, definitely, I'll call you.

"OK. Thanks. You too. OK, bye now. Bye."

"Shit," He turned to Gwin. "Yeah so four patches is the safe minimum,
apparently. It's going to get worse. Also, we need to buy fresh orange
juice, and mango sorbet."

"Really?" Gwin asked. "Is that what Molly said?"

"No. No, I'm just going to need gallons of fresh orange juice and
buckets of mango sorbet to get myself through this. It's fucking
Christmas, and I can't even have a whisky.---Oh! Hot apple cider, I
might need some of that too."
