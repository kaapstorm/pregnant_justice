"Molly Keith speaking?" answered Molly.

"Hi, Molly," said Gwin, "this is Gwin Crowbell."

"Hi Gwin. How are you?"

"I'm fine, well, yeah, I'm fine."

"Is this about Herman?"

"No. Uh. Can we maybe meet up for coffee, somewhere we can talk?"

"Sure."

"OK. When would work for you?" Gwin asked.

"How about now? We could meet at the coffee stand at the corner of the
park, and then find a quiet bench?" suggested Molly.

"That would be great," Gwin said. "And Molly?"

"Yeah?"

"Thank you."

"No problem. I'll see you soon."

"OK bye."

"Bye."

A short while later Gwin and Molly were sitting on a bench, in scarves
and gloves, curled around their coffees.

"I don't really know what I'm feeling, or why I'm feeling like this,"
Gwin started.

Molly listened.

"But I think about it all the time now, and I can't be the supportive
wife I know I'm supposed to be. And I figured maybe you would have some
advice, because obviously our situation is a little weird, but I
thought maybe lesbian couples have ... I don't know ... maybe when
you're a woman and you're not pregnant, you still have thoughts and
feelings. Do you know what I mean?"

"Actually, maybe I do. But tell me more," Molly prompted.

"Excuse my language, but I feel strongly about this. My first feeling is
that this is so fucked up. You know?"

"Yeah."

"This is a deep violation. I'm a woman. I feel like Herman has stolen
some part of my identity ... in our relationship. And then I feel
guilty of course, because he didn't steal anything. That terrible bitch
Louise did. Her husband is a darling but I never really took to her. I
mean I wasn't jealous. Well, maybe a little.---That's not the point.
Herman is a victim, not a perpetrator. But some deep part of me has
been taken, and he's got it now, and he's bumbling along with it, scared
and confused like me, but he's soldiering through, like he always does.
I love him and I resent him."

Molly scootched up and leaned against her.

"Hey. You are right. Of course you're right. This is fucked up. But
there is something important I need you to know. You are still 100% you.
Nothing has been taken. Nothing is missing from you. Society has been
messaging a role to you. The woman is the mother. And of course. That
is how it has always been. But you and Herman find yourself in a
special circumstance. The man is the mother. But the woman, I mean you,
you still need to do woman kind of things. Like you said, Herman is
scared and confused. The risks are high. Nobody has ever been in this
situation before. It's confusing. That's why you need to do what women
do. Be strong. Apply all the knowledge and skills you've learned.

"In many ways you're better equipped for this pregnancy than most
mothers," Molly continued. "You have worked in a leadership position
for years. You know how to present a character that others can place
their trust and confidence in.

"But you also know that the character you present needs to be built.
After a while it's the result of knowledge and experience, but in the
beginning you just had to guess and be confident about your guesses,
didn't you?"

"Yeah," recalled Gwin.

"And the best thing for helping you to build that confidence was
affirmation," said Molly.

"Yeah, you're right. I was lucky enough to work in a very positive,
nurturing environment, and both my direct reports and those I reported
to were supportive, and encouraging," said Gwin.

"That's great. And Herman? Is Herman supportive and encouraging?"

"Sometimes. But that's not really the way he shows his love. I said
that he soldiers on? That's kind of his thing. He's a good judge
because he applies the rules. He's smart, very smart, and perceptive.
But he's not spontaneous, and he doesn't come up with creative ideas."
Gwin pondered, "I think he looks for a framework that he can apply."

"Ah. OK. That makes sense." Molly paused. "I think I have some advice
for him, about ways he can help you to be the strong, confident team
mate that the both of you need to be, to face your situation head on."

"Thank you Molly." Gwin reached over and hugged her, careful not to
squash their cardboard cups of half-drunk coffee.

"Thank you for trusting me with this, Gwin. You haven't known me for
long, and I am honored that you came to me."

"I can tell," said Gwin, "you're a good person. Call it a woman's
intuition."

"Thank you."

---

"Herman, I've got some instructions for you." Molly stated over the
phone. "This is about to get very personal. Are you alone?"

"Yes," said Herman.

"OK great," she continued. "I need you to be open-minded. I don't know
if that's a thing you're comfortable with, but my instructions are
going to get into some intimate details, OK? And I want you to take
them all in, and feel comfortable enough to ask any questions you might
have. OK?"

"Yeah?" Herman confirmed.

"Alright. Now, this is advice that I normally give husbands of women
after they've given birth. Mothers often feel like worn-out baby
factories. They are sleepless. They are tired. They are drained,
physically, and emotionally. And husbands also have a hard time. They
have new responsibilities, they have a big support burden. They are
often also tired. And they are horny. Their wives are not feeling it.
Not only are they just exhausted, but they often feel like meat sacks.
Their flesh is pillaged in ways that even you will never know. They need
to be cared for, and loved. Deeply. Sexually too, but not in a way that
makes them feel like they are meat for their partner too.

"I'm telling you this because Gwin needs just as much support as you do.
There is an important difference between Gwin's situation, and the
situation of the mother of a newborn. Obviously Gwin isn't the mother
of a newborn. With the kind of disruption that you guys are going
through, I want you to think about two things: Familiar things and
normal routines are comforting. And sometimes support is not only a
matter of giving, but often accepting, and appreciating. Part of
feeling loved is feeling valued.

"So here is how you can support her, and give her the emotional energy
and confidence to be the wife you need her to be."
